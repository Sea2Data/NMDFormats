RecordType: Does it make more sense to have it named the same in all tables. Currently it identifies nothing more than what is already known if you know the column name
SAsampled: necessary to allow real numbers?
type for LEMixedTrip (integer Y/N)
LEgear: specify FAO standard
LEmeshSize: unit, decimal (keep type as in LEselectionDeviceMeshSize)?
LEselectionDevice and VDtype: other code lists are usually string
VDhomePort and FTdepartureLocation: specified as code list, other locodes not. (see OnshoreEvent and LandingEvent)
VDlength: consider decimal?
FDStratum and FTselectionMethodCluster: type not specified, same for key and some foreign keys on FT
timezones: standardize for time/date fields
SScatchCategory and SLcatchFraction: should be code list ? Have some comments on documentation for SScatchCategory
SLyear: year is code list on sampling details
LEmixedtrip: integer ?
SLspeciesCode: this is noted as code list, but in my mind it should support more than one aphia code.
SSspeciesListName: redundant? same as SLlistName
BVvalue: String
